This is my project of using firebase drawing app with the use of together.js

Firebase

Firebase is a real-time application platform. It allows developers to build real-time, collaborative apps using only client-side code, with the Firebase cloud servers acting as the app's backend.
Firebase provides an API that lets developers store application data in a tree-like data structure that is automatically synchronized to the Firebase cloud servers and to any other clients that are listening to changes on that data. This allows for writing data-driven single-page apps that update in real-time in response to other users' actions.

TogetherJS
TogetherJS is a service for your website that makes it surprisingly easy to collaborate in real-time.Using TogetherJS two people can interact on the same page, seeing each other's cursors, edits, and browsing a site together. The TogetherJS service is included by the web site owner, and a web site can customize and configure aspects of TogetherJS's behavior on the site.For more information and to see TogetherJS in action, visit togetherjs.com.If you want to integrate TogetherJS onto your site see the wiki.
